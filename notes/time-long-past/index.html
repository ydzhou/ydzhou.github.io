He fancy climbing over the high walls, on a barren hill, looking above the sky and drinking a bottle of 1 dollar water. He fancy scoring the point over the shabby rim and fancy big-play like T-Mac.</p><p>When school is off, he grab the beat-up bag, running furiously, running to every places he is deeply attracted to. He show up in dim video-game rooms, rowdy basketball field, and teachers&rsquo; offices. Youth is always indulged with many enchating things. Those days slowly went away.</p><p>It&rsquo;s after two years, he started fancying the figure over colorful light, fancy holding her hand in a windy Summer, and drinking a cup of sago. He daze through days, reading every single message she sent in a deep love, word by word. He matured a little bit. It looks like he start knowing the change of seasons. He read Rush to the Dead Summer and Ice Fantasy. He also had a pair of name nailed on a Camphor tree.</p><p>They broke up a year later. He insisted. He started fancying those wistful affection, dreaming some weird dreams and writing sentimental poems. He learned smoking. The cigar smoke cut through the lung, wounded heart bleeding. He seldom talked, indulged with the puzzl, playing clumsily.</p><p>Years past, like any youth, many more falls into his liking.</p><p>It&rsquo;s when I took a long trip back home, we met again. A mid-age men, half bald and loosely dressed, yelled at some student-looking person. I only recognized him until I walked closely. Later on I heard he is living a poor, divorced and unkempt life.</p><p>What he was once obssessed with may have been already forgotten. Will stars wandering in the pale sky echo his wistful memory in a sleepless night? Time is a train, rushing through every station of the moments of your life. When you steps on one train, you missed the others, and you can never head back. Rails rattling, time long past faded away over the distant horizon.</p></main></div></body></html>
