				<h3>A missing game recommender for Steam users</h3>
				<p> A missing game recommender for Steam users who have suffered a long painful way to find a new and awesome game, in the flood of biased and exaggerated comments and recommendations online. </p>
				<p> I am a long-term Steam user, who has devoted hundreds of hours to have fun with my friends on various games. However, there is one thing that confuses me the most. Whenever I try to get a new game, I usually ends up buying the one that I immediately lose my interest. Every game looks fantastic, if you only have a grasp on their trailer or reviews done by "Big Website". It is so biased and not trust-worthy. That's why I try to build a simple yet powerful recommender, to at least ease my pain and it works pretty well now.</p>
				<p>It is built upon Django framework, Postgres database and an information-retrieval recommender. It is deployed on Heroku. For more info, you can check on my github page.</p>

				<h3>Parallel Computing on a Jacobian Solver</h3>
				<p>Paralle computing is a quit interesting way to distribute the workload among all the available workers, then significantly reduce the run-time relying on their teamwork. It is a smart way to tackle performance issue when we do not have high efficiency on a single processing unit. The Jacobian solver apply a update equation in each iteration, and does not require data from previous iterations. Therefore, we can get the value of the next iteration, based on that of current iteration. This property allows us to do the parallel computing within each iteration.</p>
				<p>I have used MPI technique to implement a parallelized Jacobian Solver. Implemented Jacobian Solver is used to conduct simulation to estimate properties of a large-scale reservoir. The performance gain is significant, thanks to the power of parallel computing. With the size of matrix increasing, the overhead of communications between each processor has less impact on performance. It is very practical to apply in the real-world problem.</p>

				<h3>A x86 Operating System Implementation</h3>
				<p>It is built from scratch. It contains basic memory management, including virtual memory, paging and frame allocation. It has a schedular to handle multiple threads running in parallel. It also supports a file system along with a blocking disk driver.</p>
				<p>The implementation fully functions in Bochs and demonstrates the basic concepts referred to operating system.</p>

				<h3>A Ranker for Trending Digital Products</h3>
				<p>It is a pain to be obssessed by flood of unrelated and unwilling recommendations of products. It is always feeling amazed when a site gives you the product you have favorited to some extent. That's why I have given a try to build such an application to handle above case, and it works.</p>

				<h5>A Little About Me</h5>
				<p>The love of coding flows through my vein and its power drives me nuts. I hope one day I could master it. I am always get excited with crazy thoughts and inside this tiny machine, I could do everything to apply them into real products.</p>
				<p>This is the site where I share products and projects that have been worked on in past years. I feel so interested and excited when I get them done, and can't wait to share with you.</p>
				<p>Last Decemeber, I have graduated from Texas A&M University, and am looking forward to find a spot where I could carry on what I love, coding!</p>
				<p>Among all the coding stuff, I am mostly interested in web back-end development, information retrieval and BigData. If you feel interested or have any question, feel free to shoot me a message.</p>
