title: Flatdom: A Civilization Simulator
categories: [idea]
---

It is evitable for a civilization, originated from a small settlement, to go through expedition, expansion and then warfare, finally reaching its peak. Historically speaking, many of the great ancient civilizations have set such examples. Flatdom is yet another fictional civilization where Flatone lives within. We build this to simulate how civilization will progress given different sets of natural conditions and opponent civilizations conditions.
