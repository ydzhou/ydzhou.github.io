title: Flatdom, a simulation of civilization progression
---

## Why?

Any civilization has gone through the stages of exploration into the noman land, settling and developing to prosperity, eventually being perished under warfare. This work is to simulate how different factions can survive through during a long time under the assumption where those factions are willing to explore, develop and fight.

## What is the flatdom?

Flatdom is a 2-dimension domain. Each tile can either have a settlement where beings in Flatdom, named Flatone, live, or can be a wild land. Flatones keep exploring the neighboring tiles to expand their settlement and also develop their existing settlement. Flatones can have many factions and each faction will eventually goes into a fight if it is favoring itself.

## How is the flatone doing?

Each tile in a Flatdom has a power index to indicate how developed this settlement is or how much effort this noman land need to be taken over.

Three types of events can happen in a tile,

1. Explore: This tile can only be noman land. A Flatone settlement will send out a group to take this tile and lose corresponding power index.
2. Develop: The power index of this tile will change. It is mostly likely to be increased.
3. War: If neighboring title is taken by other faction and has a higher power index, this alien faction can invade this title and they can take it once the power index of current title drops to 0. The war will cause power index of both titles drop.

For each simulation, all the tiles are calculated through one by one. Which events can happen depends on power index of target tile and its neighboring tiles. The possibility is based on normal distribution but biased to be higher for war.
       
## What does the flatdom looks like during simulation?

Following screenshots show how a 8x8 Flatdom evolves. In the first iteration, Flatdom has few titles occupied by two factions with various power.

After several rounds of simulation, it can be seen that,

1. Most of noman lands have been taken by either faction.
2. Power index of many tiles has been increased during development.
3. War has broke out in certain places, leading to decrease of power index. Few tile has even been over-turned due to surrounding enemy factions.
