title: Keep Coding, Have Fun
---

Welcome to my personal site!

I am living in a small nordic town by the Pudget Sound.

I've been coding since I was a boy and my passion never fades. My first programming language is LOGO. To today, I still remember myself got confused every time when trying to figure out where this little turtle would land.

I am a backend Software Engineer in a chitchat company. I am currently messing up some Cloud Infrastructure stuff. Previously I worked in Amazon.

In my casual time, I capture some of the most beautiful scenes of [Pacific Northernwest](https://500px.com/p/ydotzhou)
