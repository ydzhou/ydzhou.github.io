Welcome to my personal site!

I live in a nordic town by the Pudget Sound.

I love coding and sharing the interesting things I built in my casual hours. My first programming language is Logo. I still remember the tiny turtle confused me every time when I try to image where it will finally land.

I am capturing spectacular views of the [Pacific Northwest](https://500px.com/p/ydotzhou)
