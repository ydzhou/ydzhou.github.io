      <description>Why Debian？  It just works.
 Stability of Debian distro has nothing left to argue. The software can be far behind latest version. The default configurations can be lacking. And you may not have the most active community. But hey, it just works and it will not easily break.
Basic Setup Add yourself into sudoer Switch to root first, then run
/sbin/usermod -aG sudo {your-username} Add non-free and contrib repos Edit /etc/apt/sources.</description>

      <title>A simple terminal text editor written in Go</title>

      <description>I build a simple text editor in the terminal here.
Overview Similar to MVC pattern, a text editor has three independent modules:
 controller: to handle customer keyboard input and dispatch for further processing. model: to store what customer is working on and process necessary business logic. view: to render user interface of the editor  You can think of the editor is in an infinite loop. First we clear the screen and render the viewable text document content in stdout.</description>

      <title>Flatdom, a civilization simulator</title>

      <description>Why？ Any civilization is evitably strangled in a process where it starts with exploring into the wild land, then settling, developing to its most high, and eventually fallen by the warfare or other misfortune. I am deeply curious about such process and try to simulate it. For simplicity, there are only three types of events in Flatdom, exploration, development and war.
What is Flatdom? Flatdom is a 2-dimensional world. The world consists of many grids.</description>

      <description>I am living in a small nordic town by the Pudget Sound.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding since I was a boy and my passion never fades. My first programming language is LOGO. To today, I still remember myself got confused every time when trying to figure out where this little turtle would land.
I am a backend Software Engineer. I am currently messing up some Cloud Infrastructure stuff. Previously I worked in Amazon.</description>
