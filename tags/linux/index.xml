The audio does not work until I apply patches from snd_hda_macbookpro. However, I am still getting no sound if iMac goes into sleep.
Brief debugging Going through kernel messages and checking PCI devices, indicate that after machine resuming, the audio device is lost or does not turn on. The device id is reset to 0x10138409 which is not a subsystem id but the PCI device id of the main sound device.</description></item><item><title>Ready Debian 11</title><link>https://ydzhou.github.io/tech/2022-04-23-debian-11-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ydzhou.github.io/tech/2022-04-23-debian-11-setup/</guid><description>Why Debian？ Stability of Debian distro has nothing left to argue. The software can be far behind latest version. The default configurations can be lacking. And you may not have the most lousy community. But hey, it just works and it will not give you any surprise. There is a old saying,
Debian unstable is more stable than most of stable releases of other distros.
Basic Setup Even though Debian tends to work out of box, it still requires some efforts to properly setup.</description></item></channel></rss>
