I am living in a small nordic town by the Pudget Sound.

I've been coding since I was a boy and my passion never fades. My first programming language is LOGO. Til today, I still remember myself got confused every time when trying to figure out where the little turtle would land.

I detoured to the field of embedded programming during my college but ended up as a web developer after graduation.

Nowadays, I work as a backend Software Engineer, focusing on cloud computing infrastructure. Interesting topics I touched includes observability, edge networking, service mesh and etc.

In my casual time, I like to explore and build random things (not limited to programming related).
