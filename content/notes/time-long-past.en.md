In his boyhood, he fancy oversized K-pop clothing and blood-racing video games. He fancy climbing over the high walls, on a barren hill, looking above the sky and drinking a bottle of $1 water. He fancy scoring the point over the old rim and fancy big-plays like T-Mac.

When school was off, he grabbed the beat-up bag, running furiously, running to every places he was deeply bound to. He showed up in dim video-game rooms, rowdy basketball field, and teachers' offices. Youth is always indulged with many enchating things. Those days slowly went away.

It's after two years, he started liking the figure over neon lights, fancy holding her hand in a windy Summer day and drinking a cup of sago. He dazed through days, reading her messages, with a heart full of love, word by word. He grew up a little. He seems knowing the change of seasons. He finished Rush to the Dead Summer and Ice Fantasy. As well he had a pair of names carved on a Camphor tree.

They broke up a year later. He made the choice. He started having those wistful affection, weird dreams and writing sentimental poems. He learned smoking. The cigar smoke cut through the lung while wounded heart bled. He seldom talked, indulged with puzzls, playing clumsily.

Years past, many more falls into his liking.

We met again when I took a long trip back home. A mid-age men, half bald and loosely dressed, yelled at some student-looking person. I only recognized him until walked closely. I heard he is living a rough, divorced and unkempt life.

What he was once obssessed with may have been already forgotten. Will stars wandering in the pale sky echo his wistful memory in a sleepless night? Time is a train, rushing through every station of the moments of your life. When you steps on one train, you missed the others, and you can never head back. Rails rattling, time long past faded away over the distant horizon.
