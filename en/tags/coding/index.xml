Overview Similar to MVC pattern, a text editor has three independent modules:
controller: to handle customer keyboard input and dispatch for further processing. model: to store what customer is working on and process necessary business logic. view: to render user interface of the editor You can think of the editor is in an infinite loop. First we clear the screen and render the viewable text document content in stdout.</description></item><item><title>Flatdom, a civilization simulator</title><link>https://nothingowned.com/en/tech/2015-02-23-flatdom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nothingowned.com/en/tech/2015-02-23-flatdom/</guid><description>Whyï¼Ÿ Any civilization is evitably strangled in a process where it starts with exploring into the wild land, then settling, developing to its most high, and eventually fallen by the warfare or other misfortune.
